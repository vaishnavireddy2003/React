Data Flow Diagram (DFD) for User Registration Project. 
 
Level 0 (Context Diagram) 
At the highest level, we have just one process, which represents the system as a whole. 
+-------------------------------+ 
|  External Entities           |                          | 
|   - User                          |

Explanation: 
? External Entity (User): The User interacts with the User Registration System. 
? Process (User Registration System): The system processes the user registration request. 
? Data Store (User DB): The database stores registered user details. 
 
 
 
 
 
Level 1 DFD (Decomposition of Process) 
Now, let's break down the Login System process (Process 1.0) into more detailed steps. 
+------------------------------+        |      External Entity        |         
|         (User)                  |              
+------------------------------+         
          |                                         v                                +-----------------------------+       
 |    Process: 1.1 - User  | 
 |       Input Details          | 
 +-----------------------------+       
         |                              
         v                               +-----------------------------+         |     Process: 1.2 -         | 
 |    Validate Details       |         
 +-----------------------------+        
         |          v 
+------------------------------+ 
|    Data Store: User DB | 
+------------------------------+ 
         |          v 
+-------------------------------+ 
|  Process: 1.3 - Confirm | 
|  Registration Status      | 
+-------------------------------+ 
 
 
Explanation: 
1. Process 1.1 (User Input Details ): The user enters personal details like name, email, password, and contact information. 
2. Process 1.2 (Validate Details): The backend server verifies if the details entered by the user meet validation criteria. 
3. Process 1.3 (Confirm Registration Status): The system either confirms successful registration or returns an error message. 
4. Data Flow 
? The User submits their registration details via Register.js. 
? The frontend sends the details to the backend via Server.js. 
? The backend validates the provided details. 
? If validation fails, an error message is returned to the frontend. 
? If validation is successful, the details are stored in the User DB. 
? The system confirms the registration status to the user via RegistrationApp.js. 
? Register.css handles the styling for a better user experience. 
 
Additional Notes: 
? You can expand this further by adding more layers of detail or breaking down individual processes into sub-processes. 
? Security measures such as encryption and email verification can be incorporated into the system. 
? The User DB can be enhanced with fields like timestamps, verification status, and additional security fields. 
This structured DFD documentation provides a clear visualization of how data flows in the User Registration Project.
